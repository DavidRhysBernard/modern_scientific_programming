This project consists into making small contributions to the Python API.
Here are some suggestions:
-  Doc: main readme file doesn't give an example of how to find and fetch a series. It is a bit misleading since it makes it like `fetch_series` takes only keyword arguments (which don't seem to work with multiple series).
README file contains only developer information. User information is only found in a notebook which is not convenient since it is not easily discoverable. 
- Some series return columns with string types instead of types (don't remember which one).
- ...

For each of them, one would need to report an issue/feature request, and ask about the route to follow
to improve the suggestion (propose a PR, wait).
